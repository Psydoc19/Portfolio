# Salifort Motors Project: Analyzing Employee Workload and Retention Strategies using Python

## Project Overview

The Salifort Motors Project delves deep into understanding the intricacies of employee workload, satisfaction levels, and the consequent impact on retention rates within the automotive organization. Utilizing advanced data modeling techniques and analytics, this project aims to pinpoint critical factors that influence employee satisfaction and, subsequently, provide actionable strategies to enhance organizational well-being.

## Business Understanding

The primary stakeholders for the Salifort Motors Project encompass senior management, human resources departments, and team leads within Salifort Motors. Given the competitive landscape of the automotive industry and the pivotal role of skilled talent, there's an imperative need to prioritize employee satisfaction and retention. Drawing insights from industry benchmarks, organizational behavior research, and employee engagement studies, this project seeks to offer data-driven solutions tailored to Salifort Motors' unique challenges and opportunities.

## Data Understanding

The project harnesses an extensive dataset specific to Salifort Motors, capturing nuanced metrics such as employee work hours, project allocations, tenure, performance evaluations, and satisfaction indices. Spanning multiple years, this dataset provides a longitudinal view of evolving work patterns, employee sentiments, and organizational dynamics. To gain a holistic understanding, exploratory data analysis techniques, including visualizations such as heatmaps, scatter plots, and correlation matrices, were employed, facilitating a comprehensive assessment of data distributions, trends, and potential areas warranting intervention. **Note:** For more information about the data, refer to its source on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaisalqureshi/hr-analytics-and-job-prediction?select=HR_comma_sep.csv).
