# Asthma analysis project in R: Insights from the 2022 BRFSS Survey Data

## Project Summary

In this comprehensive study, I employed EDA, statistical analysis and logistic regression to explore factors contributing to asthma within the U.S. adult population, utilizing the 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data. My analysis delved into socio-demographic and lifestyle variables, aiming to understand their relationship with asthma prevalence. This project highlights the intricate interplay between individual behaviors and broader socio-demographic factors in influencing asthma risk.

**Note:** Full dataset documentation and access instructions can be found on the [CDC's BRFSS page](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2022.html).

All necessary files for the project to run smoothly are located in its directory.

Simply launch the R Quattro Markdown file named `BRFSS.qmd` and enjoy!

## Data Preparation

The initial data wrangling involved scaling down a massive dataset, making it manageable and more relevant to my asthma-centric inquiry.

## EDA, Statistical Analysis and Modeling

This research underscores the intricate interplay between genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors in asthma's etiology. It not only broadens our comprehension of asthma's determinants but also sets the stage for more targeted, effective interventions aimed at reducing asthma's impact on individuals and communities.

## Key Findings

**Asthma's Impact:**

-   Asthma leads to more poor health days, especially for those currently suffering from it, highlighting its chronic nature.

**Prevalence Across Age and Smoking:**

-   Asthma rates remain steady across age groups but peak in adults aged 55 to 64, possibly due to long-term risk exposure.

-   Smoking habits strongly correlate with asthma prevalence, emphasizing smoking's respiratory health impact.

**Influence of Gender, Race/Ethnicity, and Weight:**

-   Multiracial females, obese individuals, and past smokers face higher asthma risks, showcasing gender, race/ethnicity, and BMI's roles.

**Socio-Demographic Factors:**

-   Marital status affects asthma prevalence, with divorce potentially increasing risk and stable marriages offering protection.

-   Both underweight and obesity contribute to asthma risk, challenging conventional beliefs.

**Lifestyle's Role:**

-   Regular physical activity benefits asthma sufferers' health perceptions.

-   Asthma negatively impacts employment status, with more current sufferers unable to work.

**Geographic Variations:**

-   Significant regional differences in asthma prevalence exist in the United States, influenced by environmental factors and healthcare access.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides a nuanced understanding of asthma's determinants, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions that address the specific vulnerabilities of high-risk groups. By integrating these insights into public health strategies, healthcare professionals and policymakers can better manage and mitigate asthma's impact on affected populations.
